Okay I am writting in latex a cheatsheet for a mathmatical financial forcasting struture I am developing. Some of the base level principles is that W being networth is a vector of envelopes accounting for all money associated to an individual. These envelopes can positive or negative meaning debt. W[n] is the networth at time n. n is a value between 0 and N with N being the total number of days in an individuals life. A defined function takes argument of an evelope to apply it to and parameters of the function. some of the fundamential equations are a*u(t-tk) being a inflow of cash a into an envelope at time tk outflow is -b*u(t-tk). u(t) is the unit step function. All of the envelopes  have a u(t) aaplied to them as its a causal system. Can you write the latex to be a cheat sheet for these equations explaining the mathmatics, parameters breifly
